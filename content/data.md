# NuGrid Data Releases

* NuGrid data Set 1 consists of 2 metallicities, Z=0.01 (set 1.1) and Z=0.02 (set
1.2) and is published in [Pignatari et al.
2016](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ApJS..225...24P).  
* An extension of Set1
(Set1ext) adds three lower metallicites, as well as additional masses at all
metallicities and MESA based massive star models for Z=0.01 and 0.02 ([Ritter
et al. 2017](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017arXiv170908677R)). Please go to
[Set 1](data-and-software/yields/set-1) of the Yields pageÂ in the [Yields
