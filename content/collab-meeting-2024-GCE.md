# A Basic Training Program for Galactic Chemical Evolution
### Contact: Blanka Világos, Viola Hegedűs, Dr. Marco Pignatari

## Summary 


In this activity, students and interested participants will learn about basic concepts for galactic chemical evolution (GCE), how to install GCE codes and perform GCE simulations, and how to compare their results with stellar observations. The open-source JINApyCEE and NuPyCEE tools will be used for the activity.  

Participants will engage with numerical experiments using a Python notebook previously provided to the participants. The main tool adopted will be OMEGA+, a 2-zone model including a galactic (star-forming gas) and circumgalactic (hot gas reservoir) components.

The codes can be found online here:

- [JINApyCEE](https://github.com/becot85/JINAPyCEE)
- [NUpyCEE]( https://github.com/NuGrid/NuPyCEE)

with main references and instructions for the installation.


The goal of these activities is to provide first-hand experience of GCE simulations for the Milky Way Galaxy, where GCE is a fundamental tool at the intersection between different nuclear astrophysics disciplines. The activity should be accessible also to participants with limited python experience.

## How to participate

Sign up to the NuGrid open day.
The python notebooks for the activity will be released a couple of weeks before the Open Day on December 2nd 2024.
At the Open Day, solutions will be given and reviewed during a special Q&A session. Undergraduate students are particularly
welcome to join, to experience first hand the use of a computational tool adopted for scientific studies.
