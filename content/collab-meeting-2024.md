# NuGrid/IReNA/BNL day
**Monday, December 2nd 2024 @ Brookhaven National Laboratory, NY, USA**

## Our Goals

In the context of our annual NuGrid collaboration meeting, we are hosting a 
half-day event with nuclear astrophysics talks, experimental and theoretical,
open to the wider community. Our goal is to showcase recent results from the 
NuGrid collaboration and establish further connections and collaborations with
interested groups.


*This event is supported by [IReNA](https://www.irenaweb.org/), the International Research Network for
Nuclear Astrophysics. IReNA is a US National Science Foundation AccelNet
Network of Networks. It connects six interdisciplinary research networks
across 17 countries to foster collaboration, complement and enhance research 
capabilities in the US and abroad, and thus greatly accelerate progress in science.*

contact. Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly event for all.

## IReNA Code of Conduct

This code of conduct applies to all participants in the NuGrid Collaboration meeting. We welcome comments and suggestions.
IReNA workshops and conferences are committed to providing a welcoming,
inclusive, professional, and safe environment for everyone that encourages the
free expression and exchange of scientific ideas and is characterized by an
atmosphere of tolerance, equity, and mutual respect, regardless of any
personal attributes such as gender, race, etc. Harassment or bullying in any
form will not be tolerated. All communication should be appropriate for a
professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Be kind
to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Behave professionally.

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments or jokes related to nationality,
gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appea
ance, body size, race, religion, as well as sexual images in public spaces,
deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or
recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate 
physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.
Bullying is defined as unwelcome or unreasonable behavior that demeans,
intimidates, humiliates, or sabotages people, either as individuals or as a
group. It includes physical bullying, verbal abuse, disparagement,
intimidation, exclusion, or spreading personal rumors.


Participants asked to stop unacceptable behavior are expected to comply
immediately. IReNA will not allow retaliation against any individual who makes
a report of known or suspected code of conduct violation. Sanctions against
attendees violating these rules are at the sole discretion of the conference
organizers and may range from warnings to being asked to leave the event, and
exclusion from future IReNA sponsored meetings.
