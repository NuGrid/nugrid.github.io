# NuGrid/IReNA/BNL day
**Monday, December 2nd 2024 @ Brookhaven National Laboratory, NY, USA**

## Our Goals

In the context of our annual NuGrid collaboration meeting, we are hosting a 
half-day event with nuclear astrophysics talks, experimental and theoretical,
open to the wider community. Our goal is to showcase recent results from the 
NuGrid collaboration and establish further connections and collaborations with
interested groups.


*This event is supported by [IReNA](https://www.irenaweb.org/), the International Research Network for
Nuclear Astrophysics. IReNA is a US National Science Foundation AccelNet
Network of Networks. It connects six interdisciplinary research networks
across 17 countries to foster collaboration, complement and enhance research 
capabilities in the US and abroad, and thus greatly accelerate progress in science.*

Code of Conduct. Any participant who wishes to report a violation of this
policy is encouraged to speak to [Shuya Ota](mailto:sota@bnl.gov), as he has agreed to serve as a point of
contact. Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly event for all.

## The 2024 CaNPAN/NuGrid Training Program
### Contact: Dr. Pavel Denisenkov, University of Victoria, Canada

#### Summary

CaNPAN is excited to announce its Fall 2024 training program for students specializing in experimental
nuclear physics or stellar astrophysics. This year, we are partnering with the NuGrid collaboration for their
annual meeting at Brookhaven National Laboratory in December. As a highlight of the program,
participants will contribute to a hybrid component of the NuGrid/IReNA/BNL Open Day, where they will have the
opportunity to present their projects in short talks.


#### Program Structure

Participants will engage with a series of numerical problems using computer codes and Python notebooks
from the Networkschool-tina, i-process tools, and canpan-project Git repositories. Weekly online
meetings will be held from October 17 to November to introduce students to the fundamentals of stellar
and nuclear astrophysics and guide them in the use of these computational tools.
The numerical methods taught have been successfully employed in previous studies, including:
-  Reaction rate impact studies for nova nucleosynthesis, directly connected to observed abundances
of elements like potassium and calcium in nova ejecta
-  p-nuclei production in X-ray bursts and core-collapse supernovae, linked to the observed solar
system abundances of p-process isotopes
-  Identification of neutron-capture reactions impacting predicted abundances of i-process elements,
as observed in CEMP-i and CEMP-s stars

The goal of these studies is to identify neutron-capture reactions having the strongest impact on predicted
abundances, for example on the i-process
elements observed in CEMP-i and CEMP-s stars. A list of reactions that have been identified in this way,
and their approved experimental studies at U.S. and Canadian nuclear physics
laboratories is available [here](https://canpan.ca/experiments.html).

#### Proposed Projects 

All projects will be conducted on the University of Victoria's AstroHub TINA and Outreach servers.
Students may choose from the following projects or propose their own:
- Sensitivity of p-nuclei production in X-ray bursts or core-collapse supernovae to charged-particle
reaction rate variations
- Sensitivity of K and Ca production in novae to charged-particle reaction rate variations
- Constraining rates of neutron captures by unstable isotopes using numerical simulations of i-
process nucleosynthesis in stars and astrophysical observations.

Students are encouraged to verify previous results and explore reactions
impacting other nuclei, such as p-isotopes 92Mo and 96Ru in X-ray bursts, or
unstable isotopes 7Be and 22Na in novae.
For the i-process project, students will create plots of elemental abundance ratios in CEMP-s and CEMP-i
stars, comparing observational data with i-process nucleosynthesis model predictions. They will
investigate variations in neutron-capture rates for unstable isotopes and their impact on predicted
abundances.

#### How to participate 

Participation is limited to 5 students to ensure a high level of interaction and support. Interested students
should send an email to [Dr. Pavel Denisenkov](mailto:pavelden@uvic.ca) by October 15 with the following
information:

-  Name, Institution, and Name and email address of supervisor
-  Short statement of past research experience and current research project
-  What type of project are you interested in? select one of the above mentioned or propose something
different.

Sign-up details will be provided October 16, and the program will commence on October 17.

This training program offers a unique opportunity to gain hands-on experience with cutting-edge
computational tools in nuclear astrophysics. Participants will contribute to ongoing research efforts and
develop skills valuable for future work in the field.


## IReNA Code of Conduct

This code of conduct applies to all participants in the NuGrid Collaboration meeting. We welcome comments and suggestions.
IReNA workshops and conferences are committed to providing a welcoming,
inclusive, professional, and safe environment for everyone that encourages the
free expression and exchange of scientific ideas and is characterized by an
atmosphere of tolerance, equity, and mutual respect, regardless of any
personal attributes such as gender, race, etc. Harassment or bullying in any
form will not be tolerated. All communication should be appropriate for a
professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Be kind
to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Behave professionally.

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments or jokes related to nationality,
gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appea
ance, body size, race, religion, as well as sexual images in public spaces,
deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or
recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate 
physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.
Bullying is defined as unwelcome or unreasonable behavior that demeans,
intimidates, humiliates, or sabotages people, either as individuals or as a
group. It includes physical bullying, verbal abuse, disparagement,
intimidation, exclusion, or spreading personal rumors.


Participants asked to stop unacceptable behavior are expected to comply
immediately. IReNA will not allow retaliation against any individual who makes
a report of known or suspected code of conduct violation. Sanctions against
attendees violating these rules are at the sole discretion of the conference
organizers and may range from warnings to being asked to leave the event, and
exclusion from future IReNA sponsored meetings.
