# Codes and Collaboration Facilities

At the core of the NuGrid work is the developement, verification and validation of a post-processing nucleosynthesis code (PPN) and a variety of collaboration tools.

* [NuGridPy](https://nugrid.github.io/NuGridPy) python tools to analyze NuGrid data, raw data access through CADC's VOspace.
* NuGrid Python Chemical Evolution Environment (<a href="http://nugrid.github.io/NuPyCEE/">NuPyCEE</a>)
* Public Jupyter server [WENDI](https://nugrid.github.io/content/wendi) for interactive web exploration of NuGrid data sets and NuPyCEE codes. 
* Latest nuclear physics compilations for all stellar quiescent and explosive
nucleosynthesis including NSE, _sandbox_ interface to easily test user generated rates, dynamic master network generation
* Multi-zone with mixing for complete 1D stellar evolution sequence post-processing
* Multi-trajectory capability for post-processing of hydrodynamic trajectories
* Dynamic network at the cell level to automatically generate the network size needed for given thermodynamic environment
* Multi-zone and trajectory ppn are MPI parallel
* Custom USEEPP (se) library built on hdf5 for IO data management, including C, Fortran, python and idl interfaces
* Growing test case and examples library.

### Participation and Staying Connected

If you find the NuGrid project interesting please contact any of the members. We have annual collaboration meetings where we discuss the future directions, including how to make our tools available to a wider community. If you would
like to receive occasional news and announcement about data releases, available NuGrid tools and new NuGrid publications, please consider signing up to the
[public mailing list](https://lists.uvic.ca/mailman/listinfo/nugrid-team).
