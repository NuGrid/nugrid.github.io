# Web Exploration of NuGrid Data Interative



Web Exploration of NuGrid Data Interative (WENDI) is NuGrid's
[Cyberhubs](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018ApJS..236....2H) platform that allows data analysis and exploration of the [NuGrid data
sets](./data) and also allows you to run the [NuPyCEE](https://zenodo.org/record/1288697) NuGrid Python Galactic Chemical Evolution Environment. There are both python notebook templates and GUI based access options. There is also a cyberhub
application that allows you to run the MESA stellar evolution code.

WENDI It is a jupyter based platform and you just need a github account to login. If you would like to perform a longer-term research project or a training session with WENDI please contact Falk Herwig so that we can ensure stable access and storage, maybe to one of the backup servers.

WENDI now exists as a hub inside [Astrohub](https://astrohub.uvic.ca) developed and operated by the UVic group. 

* NuGrid members: To gain access to WENDI for NuGrid members (red hub) please contact the membership administrator with your GitHub username so you can be added to the server.
* Other users:  [Astrohub](https://astrohub.uvic.ca) offers a public _Outreach_ hub (grey hub) that can be used by anyone. Authentication via GitHub user name. Restrictions apply.

WENDI started out as a [CANFAR](http://www.canfar.net/en) project and is running on virtual CANFAR servers provided by [Compute Canada](https://www.computecanada.ca). Specifically, these servers run on the [WestGrid Arbutus](https://www.westgrid.ca/support/systems/arbutus) cloud machine operated at the [University of Victoria](https://www.uvic.ca). Development of the [Cyberhubs](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018ApJS..236....2H) software stack was supported by NSERC through a Discovery grant  to Falk Herwig, NSF through a CDS&E grant to Paul Woodward and through the NSF Physics Frontier center JINA-CEE and through a Canarie platform developement grant _Software-as-a-Service_.
