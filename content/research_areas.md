# NuGrid Collaboration

### Publications
[NuGrid on ADS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/fq=%7B!type%3Daqp%20v%3D%24fq_database%7D&fq_database=(database%3Aastronomy%20OR%20database%3Aphysics)&q=ack%3A%22NuGrid%22%20%20or%20aff%3A%22NuGrid%22%20&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc&p_=0)

### Research Areas
In addition to the primary goals the collaboration facilitates projects (in
varying degrees of completion) in the following research areas (in no
particular order). If you like to get in touch with NuGrid members
participating in any of these projects, please get in touch with the present PI
(see below). They are centred around nucleosynthesis and the impact of nuclear
physics on stellar evolution, supernovae, etc, and their chemical yields.
