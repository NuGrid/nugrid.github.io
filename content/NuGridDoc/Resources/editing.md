Markdown is a a markup language that makes it easy to create nice
looking documents in and ascii editor. This is the language that we
are using on the wikis for documentation, and generally for any text
documents on the [NuGrid github
organzation](http://github.com/nugrid). Markdown is also the dialect
that text cells in _ipython_ notebooks are written in. So, _markdown_
