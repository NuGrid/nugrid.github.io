# Code of Conduct

The code of conduct aims to set basic standards of behavior that reflect our shared values. It is also an essential part of the NuGrid approach that enables us to reach our goals. The code of conduct applies to all NuGrid participants. It does not replace or supersede any local institutional codes of conduct, anti- discrimination policies, or anti-harassment policies. In some instances, the Code establishes policies and/or requirements that would not otherwise be required in some. We welcome comments and suggestions to improve and evolve this document in the future.

The present Code of Conduct should be framed as a journey of learning about the perspective of others. It should help in dealing with the social part of science, where there can be confusion about what the right answer is, or if there is a right answer. Therefore, it also aims to provide a space for real, substantive and honest conversation where everyone can share their beliefs and explain. Shared journeys can become an opportunity to make the way we collaborate better.

As NuGrid member and participants

## We behave professionally and respectfully

We maintain a professional environment that encourages the free expression and exchange of scientific ideas and is characterized by an atmosphere of tolerance, equity, and mutual respect, regardless of race and other personal attributes, including but not limited to: (alphabetically) age, disability, ethnicity, gender, gender expression, gender identity, lactation, nationality, physical appearance, pregnancy, race, religion, sexual orientation, and status as a caregiver (including as a parent). Behaviors and language acceptable to one person may not be to another. We make every effort to ensure that words and actions communicate respect for others. In particular, during international travels we should be conscious of local customs and rules at the host institute/country. This is e.g., because of different government, organization, funding systems. It is recommended to respect local rules and staff, especially if the travel is temporary and not a long stay. 

## We foster a welcoming and inclusive work environment

We respect and value differences. We avoid offending others by exercising restraint, and are aware that statements or actions not intended to be offensive to another person may be perceived as such. We welcome anti-racist efforts within our collaboration, we actively discourage discrimination, and we refrain from unpleasant or disparaging remarks or actions, in particular on the basis of sex, age, religion, beliefs, nationality, culture, ethnicity, race, sexual orientation, status, disability, or family situation.

## We conduct research with professional integrity, honesty, and following ethical standards

All NuGrid-lead research activities should apply the guidelines indicated in the NuGrid Manifesto.

More in general, we follow APS guidelines for professional conduct  and the AAS research Code of Ethics. We actively foster an environment where new scientific ideas can be shared freely without fear of being taken advantage of. We praise scientific merit, wisdom and all the precious mentorship efforts with the aim to train students and new generations of scientists. We ensure that we credit others for their contribution and declare conflicts of interest. For publications we acknowledge work of others, and offer co-authorship to all who have contributed significantly to the inception, design, execution, or interpretation of the research.

## We do not tolerate harassment

We are committed to providing a safe, harassment-free and discrimination-free environment for everyone. We adopt the definitions of harassment by the American Astronomical Society (AAS), aligned with the definition used by the code of conduct of the European Physical Society (EPS). Harassment includes offensive comments or denigrating jokes related to nationality, gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion; sexual images in public spaces; deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording; inappropriate physical contact; and unwelcome sexual attention.

All NuGrid members and participants, including participants at any NuGrid activities, are expected to comply with the applicable anti-harassment, anti-discrimination laws and policies in effect at their home institutions, and the institutions they are located at, including mandatory reporting requirements.

## We do not tolerate bullying

Bullying in any form, including, but not limited to, physical bullying, verbal abuse, disparagement, intimidation, exclusion, spreading personal rumors, is not tolerated. Bullying is defined as unwelcome or unreasonable behavior that demeans, intimidates, humiliates, or sabotages people, either as individuals or as a group.


## Procedure reporting any issues

We encourage everybody to report violations of this policy to a NuGrid PI. It is the duty of the contacted PI to raise the concern with the other PIs, and to take the necessary measures to solve the matter in place in the best possible ways for all parties. Any form of retaliation for reporting, speaking up, or intervening in response to code of conduct violations would be seen as an additional violation of the code of conduct. In case there is something to report, a direct confrontation with the other party should be avoided if possible. 

In case the point of the contact (possibly one of the NuGrid PIs) is directly involved with the matter, another NuGrid PI should be contacted. If you are a student, it is recommended to also make your supervisor aware of the situation as soon as possible. 

It is highly recommended to report any incident in writing. The NuGrid PI responsible will have hearings from both parties before reporting to the other PIs. There is a general expectation that the NuGrid PI and both parties should make full effort to solve the problem in a friendly manner that satisfies both parties.
