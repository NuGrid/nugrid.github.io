# Acknowlegements

NuGrid acknowledges support from NSF grants PHY 02-16783 and PHY 08-22648
(Joint Institute for Nuclear Astrophysics, JINA), NSF grant PHY-1430152 (JINA
Center for the Evolution of the Elements), EU MIRG-CT-2006-046520 and STFC
(through the University of Hull’s Consolidated Grant ST/R000840/1), 
ChETEC COST Action (CA16117) supported by COST (European Cooperation in Science and Technology), and 
from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement 
No 101008324 (ChETEC-INFRA). 
The continued work on codes and in disseminating data is made possible through
funding from STFC (RH, UK), an NSERC Discovery grant (FH, Canada) and support
from SNF (MP, Switzerland). NuGrid computations are performed at the
high-performance computer KHAOS at EPSAM Institute at Keele University (UK) as
well as CFI (Canada) funded computing resources at the Department of Physics
and Astronomy at the University of Victoria and through Computing Time Resource
Allocation through the Compute Canada WestGrid consortium. We also acknowledge
support by the STFC DiRAC High Performance Computing Facilities, and ongoing
resource allocations on the University of Hulls High Performance Computing
Facility VIPER. The collaboration uses services of the Canadian Advanced
Network for Astronomy Research (CANFAR) which in turn is supported by CANARIE,
Compute Canada, University of Victoria, the National Research Council of
Canada, and the Canadian Space Agency. RH acknowledges support from the World
Premier International Research Center Initiative (WPI Initiative), MEXT, Japan
and funding from the European Research Council under the European Union's
Seventh Framework Programme (FP/2007-2013) / ERC Grant Agreement n. 306901.
TP acknowledges support from the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft 
(DFG, German Research Foundation)-Project No. 279384907-SFB 1245, and the 
State of Hesse within the Research Cluster ELEMENTS (Project ID 500/10.006). NuGrid research has used the Astrohub online virtual research environment (https://astrohub.uvic.ca), developed and operated by the Computational Stellar Astrophysics group (http://csa.phys.uvic.ca) at the University of Victoria and hosted on the Computed Canada Arbutus Cloud at the University of Victoria.
