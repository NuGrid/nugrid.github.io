# NuGrid Collaboration

### Research Areas
In addition to the primary goals the collaboration facilitates projects (in
varying degrees of completion) in the following research areas (in no
particular order). If you like to get in touch with NuGrid members
participating in any of these projects, please get in touch with the present PI
(see below).

* Stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis
* Massive stars
* AGB and SAGB stars
* Supernova explosions, explosive nucleosynthesis, core collapse and Type Ia
* Galactic chemical evolution
* Nucleosynthesis in compact objects (e.g., nova, RCB stars, X-ray bursts,
neutron-star mergers)
* Nuclear physics impact on stellar physics and nucleosynthesis
* Nucleosynthesis processes (e.g., r process, rp process, i process, s
process, p process)
