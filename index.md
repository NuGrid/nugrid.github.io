# NuGrid Collaboration

The Nucleosynthesis Grid (NuGrid) collaboration, formed in fall 2007, develops
and maintains tools for large scale post-processing nucleosynthesis simulations
with up-to-date and flexible nuclear physics input, and apply these to complete
sets of quiescent and explosive nuclear production environments.

### Science Goal
Our science goal is to provide complete sets of stellar evolution sequences for
low-mass and massive stars with compatible input physics, including explosion
simulations, and calculate the complete nucleosynthesis with the same
post-processing code. In this way we will obtain a high degree of internal
consistency. We plan to generate yield sets covering the entire mass and
metallicity space, in collaboration with teams working in galactic chemical
evolution and near-field cosmology.

### Approach
The NuGrid approach is characterized by a commitment to forward modeling based
on our physics understanding of the involved processes, verification and
validation, and uncertainty quantification, including the important aspect of
nuclear physics input.

### Research Areas
In addition to the primary goals the collaboration facilitates projects (in
varying degrees of completion) in the following research areas (in no
particular order). If you like to get in touch with NuGrid members
participating in any of these projects, please get in touch with the present PI
(see below).

* Stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis
    * Massive stars
    * AGB and SAGB stars
* Supernova explosions, explosive nucleosynthesis, core collapse and Type Ia
* Galactic chemical evolution
* Nucleosynthesis in compact objects (e.g., nova, RCB stars, X-ray bursts,
neutron-star mergers)
* Nuclear physics impact on stellar physics and nucleosynthesis
* Nucleosynthesis processes (e.g., r process, rp process, i process, s
process, p process)
