# NuGrid Collaboration

The Nucleosynthesis Grid (NuGrid) collaboration, formed in fall 2007, develops
and maintains tools for large scale post-processing nucleosynthesis simulations
with up-to-date and flexible nuclear physics input, and apply these to complete
sets of quiescent and explosive nuclear production environments.

### Science Goal
Our science goal is to provide complete sets of stellar evolution sequences for
low-mass and massive stars with compatible input physics, including explosion
simulations, and calculate the complete nucleosynthesis with the same
post-processing code. In this way we will obtain a high degree of internal
consistency. We plan to generate yield sets covering the entire mass and
metallicity space, in collaboration with teams working in galactic chemical
evolution and near-field cosmology.

### Approach
The NuGrid approach is characterized by a commitment to forward modeling based
on our physics understanding of the involved processes, verification and
validation, and uncertainty quantification, including the important aspect of
nuclear physics input.
